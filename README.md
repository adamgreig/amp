# Adam Magic Probe

A clone of the wonderful
[Black Magic Probe](http://www.blacksphere.co.nz/main/blackmagic) but in KiCAD 
and with a few small hardware tweaks.

As such this work is also distributed under the CC-BY-SA licence.

This is a really useful tool for ARM development and I'm incredibly grateful 
that it's open hardware and firmware. You should consider buying one!

## Changes From Black Magic Mini

* MicroUSB port
* No LEDs
* Cheaper, higher current LDO
* TagConnect for programming the host STM32
